# Xyra - Visual Desktop for Linux VPS (Windows Client)

**Xyra** is a lightweight **desktop-style dashboard** designed for **VPS users** who mainly work through the **console** and **FTP**. Instead of managing files only through terminal commands or external tools, **Xyra** provides a **visual desktop environment** for browsing, editing, uploading, and organizing server files more comfortably.

The **goal of this project is not to replace the terminal**, but to make remote server management more intuitive and visually accessible — especially for developers who prefer a desktop-like workflow while still working on a VPS.

**Features:**
- Visual file management with drag-and-drop uploads  
- Quick text editing of server files  
- Persistent folder and icon layout  
- SSH tool integration (PuTTY / Termius)  
- Background customization and intuitive interface

**Version:**

Version: Xyra Core v0.9.2 beta
